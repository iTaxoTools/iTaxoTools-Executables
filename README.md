# iTaxoTools-executables
Compiled executables for Windows, Linux and MacOS systems. The current releases (for the three operating systems; published on 26 March 2021) are to be considered as pre-releases (v0.0.1 alpha) where some programs may still contain bugs. All tools are available for Windows (tested on Windows 7 and Windows 10 systems) and Linux, whereas only a selection of tools have so far been compiled for Mac. See description of the releases for details. 
The most updated versions of the code for all tools is found in the dedicated repositories hosted by the iTaxoTools organization.
